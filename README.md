### NLTK installation:
Steps below comes from instructions from the course **COMS4805 Natural Language Processing** in Spring 2015.

1. Add NLTK’s location to your default path:
	* Add the following line of code to your ~/.bashrc file.<br />
	```export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/cs4701/python/lib/python2.7/site-packages```
	* After, don’t forget to run: <br />
	```source ~/.bashrc```
2. Create a link to the NLTK files (equivalent to downloading the files yourself)
	* Login to your CLIC account and run the following commands in your home directory.<br />
	```ln –s ~coms4705/nltk_data nltk_data```

	* This one analyzed the need of query reformulation and relevance feedback in the context of Web searching. Though it's not telling us things about query expansion, I found some of its references might be helpful. I would list them as items below.
